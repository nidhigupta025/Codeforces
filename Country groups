Ques:
Ninja has been appointed as a data scientist for a MNC. He has been provided with a huge list of people who belong to some countries. 
He doesn't know who belongs to which country, but he knows which two people belong to the same country. Now, he has been asked to find the 
total number of unique countries this group of people belong to.
Ninja has many other projects to work on, therefore he has passed on this task to you. Are you up to the challenge?
